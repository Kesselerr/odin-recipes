    <h1>Milanesas</h1>
<img src="../recipes/fotos/mila.jpg">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Similar to the Austrian wiener schnitzel, the Italian cotoletta alla Milanese, and the Japanese tonkatsu, the Argentinian milanesa is also a breaded cutlet shallow-fried in oil. The cutlet typically comes either from the round or from the eye of the round, which are lean cuts, meaning they have less fat, marbling, and sinew when compared to most other cuts of beef. Besides beef, milanesa can also be prepared with veal, pork, or be made vegetarian by using soy cutlets or eggplant instead. The first step when preparing milanesa is to prepare the meat, which means removing any fat or sinew to get as clean of cutlets as possible, which are then pounded with a mallet until a half a centimeter thick. The cutlets are then first dipped typically in a mixture of beaten eggs, chopped garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper, but, depending on the recipe, this mixture can also include mustard. Once soaked in the egg mixture, the cutlets are dredged in breadcrumbs and then shallow-fried in a pan until golden. The milanesa should be served warm, with just a drizzle of lemon juice and a side of mashed potatoes or fries. In Argentina, they also have variations on the basic milanesa, such as caballo, which is milanesa topped with an egg and milanesa a la napolitana, which has a topping of tomato salsa, ham, and mozzarella cheese.

</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cumin</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>½ cup raisins</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
    <li>2 large hard-cooked eggs, peeled and chopped</li>


</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Make the dough: Stir flour and salt together in a medium bowl. Cut in shortening using a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Use a fork to stir in water, a few tablespoons at a time, until the mixture comes together. Pat into a ball and flatten slightly. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.

</li>
<li>Make the filling while dough is chilling: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add beef, paprika, cumin, pepper, and salt; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess grease, then stir in the raisins and vinegar. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.</li>
<li>Remove dough and filling from the refrigerator. Form dough into twenty-four 2-inch balls. Stir hard-cooked eggs into filling.

</li>
<li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
<li>While the oil is heating, roll one ball dough on a floured surface into a thin circle. Spoon some filling onto the center, fold dough into a half-moon shape, and press the edges with your fingers to seal. Repeat to fill and form remaining empanadas.</li>
<li>Working in batches, fry 1 to 2 empanadas at a time in hot oil until browned, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot.</li>

<h1>Locro</h1>
<img src="../recipes/fotos/locro.jpg">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Wintertime in Argentina – cosy up inside with a large glass of oak Cabernet Sauvignon and serve yourself a warming bowl of locro, the hearty meat and corn-based stew of northern Argentina. Locro is no everyday meal. Almost a national dish, locro is a hearty, yellowy-orange concoction most significantly linked with the 25th May celebrations of Argentine revolution.
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup of dried white corn (hominy)</li>
    <li>2 medium white onions, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic, finely sliced</li>
    <li>1 leek, finely sliced</li>
    <li>200g thick-sliced smoked bacon (panceta salada), cubed</li>
    <li>2 slightly spicy sausages (chorizo de cerdo), sliced</li>
    <li>2 1-inch thick steaks of stewing beef, osso buco, cuadril or similar, cubed</li>
    <li>1 cup tripe (mondongo – optional!), diced</li>
    <li>1 cup lima beans (porotos pallares, optional)</li>
    <li>Pigs feet (patitas de cerdo – optional)</li>
    <li>Ground black pepper and salt to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup butternut squash (zappallo anco), cubed</li>
    <li>1 cup sweet potato (batata), diced</li>
    <li>1 large potato</li>
    <li>Chopped spring onion (green onion, cebolla de verdeo) for garnish</li>
    
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Soak the dried white corn in at least two cups of water, at least for 12 hours – preferably overnight.</li>
<li>In a large, heavy-based pot cook the onions, garlic, leek, stewing beef, sausages, pigs feet and tripe if you’re brave, and bacon in a little vegetable oil until the onions are translucent. Add the cumin, paprika, a little salt, and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
<li>Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add the white corn kernels and then add enough hot water to cover the ingredients by about 2 inches.</li>
<li>Add the vegetables and the lima beans, if using. Bring the whole thing to a boil, reduce the heat, cover and simmer for around two hours. Check the pot every 20 minutes or so and stir.</li>
<li>After two hours remove the pan lid and continue to cook over a low heat. Remove the bones. Mash the vegetables slowly, and as the starch gets released the mixture will thicken into a stew. Continue mashing and cooking until you have achieved a rich, thick consistency. Add a little more salt to taste.</li>
